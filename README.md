# Zahlenratespiel
Hello everyone :)
Im pretty new in Python and of course in programming. Maybe my Username told you ;D

This little script is just about guessing random created Numbers.
After guessing the right number, you'll reach the next level. 
For more 'fun' i decided to limitate the Time and the tries when you reach level 10. 

The Code is mostly written with german variables, also the menu is in german. 
I already put it on my TODO-List to translate the menu.

I'm not afraid of getting critic, so when you think some lines are sh*t, then pls tell me.
If you have a good Idea what could this little game make better, tell me :)
